"""Daphne is a HTTP, HTTP2, and WebSocket protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP, developed 
specifically for use with Django Channels. It's commonly used in Django applications that 
require WebSocket functionality for real-time communication."""

# Here's when and why you might use Daphne with WebSocket in Django:

# ASGI Compatibility: 

"""Daphne is an ASGI server, which means it's compatible with Django Channels, a framework for 
handling asynchronous HTTP requests and WebSocket connections in Django. If you're building 
a Django application that requires WebSocket functionality, you need an ASGI server like 
Daphne to serve WebSocket connections alongside HTTP requests."""

# WebSocket Support: 

"""Daphne natively supports the WebSocket protocol, allowing it to handle WebSocket connections 
efficiently. This makes it well-suited for applications that require bidirectional, real-time 
communication between clients and the server, such as chat applications, live updates, 
notifications, and multiplayer games."""

# Scalability and Performance: 

"""Daphne is designed to handle high-concurrency and high-throughput workloads, making it suitable 
for production environments where scalability and performance are critical. It can efficiently 
manage a large number of WebSocket connections and HTTP requests, ensuring that your application 
remains responsive under heavy load."""

# Integration with Django Channels: 

"""Daphne integrates seamlessly with Django Channels, allowing you to deploy WebSocket-enabled Django 
applications with minimal configuration. By using Daphne alongside Django Channels, you can take 
advantage of Django's familiar development environment while leveraging the power of asynchronous 
programming for handling WebSocket connections."""

#Production-Grade Deployment: 

"""Daphne is suitable for production deployments of Django applications that require WebSocket support.
It's widely used in production environments to serve WebSocket connections alongside HTTP requests, 
providing reliability, stability, and performance for real-time web applications."""


"""In summary, you would use Daphne with WebSocket in Django when building real-time web applications 
that require bidirectional communication between clients and the server. By leveraging Daphne's 
support for the WebSocket protocol and its integration with Django Channels, you can develop and 
deploy WebSocket-enabled Django applications with ease, ensuring scalability, performance, and 
reliability in production environments."""

#  how to impliment daphne  in below websocket using django rest framework 

'''To implement Daphne with your WebSocket using Django Rest Framework, you need to set up Daphne as the 
ASGI server to handle WebSocket connections. Here's how you can do it:'''

1. **Install Daphne**:
   First, you need to install Daphne if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

   pip install daphne

2. **Configure Daphne as the ASGI Server**:
   Modify your ASGI application in the `settings.py` file to use Daphne as the ASGI server. 
   Change the value of `ASGI_APPLICATION` to point to your ASGI application with Daphne:

   # settings.py
   ASGI_APPLICATION = 'your_project_name.asgi.application'  
   # Change 'your_project_name' to your actual project name

3. **Create ASGI Application**:
   Create an ASGI application file named `asgi.py` in your project directory if you haven't 
   already. This file will serve as the entry point for Daphne:

   ```python
   # asgi.py

   import os
   from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application

   os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')  
   # Change 'your_project_name' to your actual project name

   application = get_asgi_application()
   ```

4. **Run Daphne**:
   Now, you can run Daphne to serve your WebSocket application. You typically specify the routing 
   configuration file and the interface and port to listen on. Run the following command:

   #daphne -p <port> your_project_name.asgi:application

   Replace `<port>` with the port number you want Daphne to listen on, and `your_project_name` 
   with your actual project name.

5. **Test Your WebSocket**:
   With Daphne running, you can now test your WebSocket by connecting to it from your frontend code.

'''
By following these steps, you can integrate Daphne as the ASGI server to handle WebSocket connections
for your Django Rest Framework application. Make sure to replace `'your_project_name'` with the actual 
name of your Django project.
