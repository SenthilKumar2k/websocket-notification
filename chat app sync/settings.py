Explanation:

1)  Installed Apps: Add 'channels' to the INSTALLED_APPS setting to include Django Channels in your project.

2)  ASGI Application: Specify the ASGI application for channels by providing the path to your routing 
configuration. Replace 'your_project_name' with the actual name of your Django project.

3)  Channel Layers: Define the channel layers setting to configure the backend for channel communication. 
In this example, we're using an in-memory channel layer for development. For production, consider 
using Redis or other supported backends.
