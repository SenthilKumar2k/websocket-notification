In the provided code, the NotificationConsumer does not have a receive method because it doesn't need to handle incoming messages from the client. This is common in scenarios where the WebSocket consumer is only responsible for sending notifications to clients based on events triggered elsewhere in the application.

#  Here's why the receive method is not necessary in this context:

1) Purpose of the Consumer: The primary purpose of the NotificationConsumer in this case is to facilitate sending notifications to clients when triggered by other parts of the application, such as the NotificationView class.

2) One-way Communication: The communication flow is one-way: notifications are generated by the server-side code and sent to the connected WebSocket clients. There's no requirement for clients to send messages back to the server in this scenario.

3) Simplicity and Efficiency: By omitting the receive method, the consumer becomes simpler and more efficient. It focuses solely on handling connections, disconnections, and sending notifications, reducing unnecessary code complexity.

4) Scalability and Performance: Handling only outgoing messages can improve scalability and performance by reducing the processing overhead on the server. Since the consumer doesn't need to handle incoming messages, it can dedicate more resources to efficiently sending notifications to connected clients.

If your application needs bidirectional communication where clients also send messages to the server over WebSocket, you would include a receive method in the consumer to handle those incoming messages. However, if the server is only responsible for pushing data to clients without expecting any responses, having a receive method is not necessary.
